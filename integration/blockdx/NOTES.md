# Block DX — what a submission needs

Block DX replied to the enquiry sent 2026-08-18 and pointed at a GitHub
repository. The one that matters is not `blocknetdx/block-dx`, which is the
client, but
[`blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files`](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files),
which is where the 142 coins it can trade are described.

An earlier version of this directory held a single `xbridge.conf` written from
a general idea of what XBridge wants. That was wrong in form: their repository
takes three separate things, and a pull request shaped like the guess would not
have applied.

## The three files

| From here | To there |
|---|---|
| [`xbridge-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf`](xbridge-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf) | `xbridge-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf` |
| [`wallet-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf`](wallet-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf) | `wallet-confs/wam--v0.1.9.conf` |
| [`manifest-entry.json`](manifest-entry.json) | one object appended to `manifest-latest.json` |

## Every value, and where it comes from

Read off `bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf` in their repository, because WAM is a Bitcoin
Core fork and that entry is the closest thing they already ship.

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `Port` | 9554 | RPC port, not p2p — their `Port` is what XBridge calls |
| `AddressPrefix` | 73 | `base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS]` |
| `ScriptPrefix` | 135 | `base58Prefixes[SCRIPT_ADDRESS]` |
| `SecretPrefix` | 190 | `base58Prefixes[SECRET_KEY]` |
| `BlockTime` | 120 | `WAM_POW_TARGET_SPACING` |
| `COIN` | 100000000 | eight decimals, as Bitcoin |
| `dir_name_linux` | `wam` | the node's own default data directory is `~/.wam` |
| `conf_name` | `wam.conf` | measured by running `wamd`, not assumed |

**`GetNewKeySupported=false` and `ImportWithNoScanSupported=false`** follow
Bitcoin v0.17 rather than Litecoin v0.15. Those two flags describe a wallet
that will hand out a raw private key and import one without a rescan, which
descriptor wallets in modern Core do not do. WAM is a v28.1 fork, so claiming
otherwise would fail at the first swap rather than at submission.

**`MinTxFee=10000` and `FeePerByte=10`** are Litecoin's numbers, not Bitcoin's
12000/60, because those reflect a congested fee market WAM does not have. Ten
satoshis per byte is ten times the relay minimum a WAM node enforces, which
leaves room without inventing a fee market.

**`Confirmations=60`.** It was `0`, and it was the only value in that file
with no reason written beside it.

The cost of reversing a confirmation is set by hashrate, not by block timing.
On 6 September 2026 this chain ran at 5,400-6,100 H/s, and one ordinary
desktop measures 8,740 H/s on eight threads -- so the whole network is weaker
than a single computer, and out-hashing it for six hours costs under ten
dollars of rented CPU. That is ordinary for a chain three weeks old and it is
exactly why the number here matters: a swap settled at zero confirmations on
such a chain is not settled at all.

Sixty blocks is two hours at a 120-second target. It is deliberately slower
than a DEX would like. It is the same number this project publishes for an
exchange deposit, and asking for it here rather than discovering later why it
was needed is the whole point.

## The version in the filename

Their names carry the wallet version a config was verified against —
`litecoin--v0.15.1.conf`. A new file goes beside it when a release changes
anything XBridge reads.

Ours said `v0.1.6` from 21 August, which was right while WAM was pre-launch
and the number was still moving. The PR says so in as many words, and promises
one update after launch to the release people would actually be running:

> the conf is named for the wallet release it targets, and WAM is still
> pre-launch, so that number is moving. Mainnet opens on 15 September 2026 and
> I will update this entry once to the release people will actually be
> running, rather than resubmitting for each pre-release.

That is this change. Mainnet opened on 15 September and v0.1.9 is what nodes
run, so the files are `wam--v0.1.9.conf` and `versions` lists v0.1.8 and
v0.1.9 — both signed, both carrying Linux, Windows and macOS builds. Nothing
inside either file changed: every value was already verified against the
consensus source and is unchanged by v0.1.7, v0.1.8 or v0.1.9.

The older releases are dropped from `versions` deliberately. They still sync
mainnet — the consensus floor is v0.1.5 — but v0.1.6 predates launch, and a
list is a recommendation to somebody deciding what to install.
