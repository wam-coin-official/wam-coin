//  seeds.js -- how many DNS seeds this network has, and how many answer
// ===========================================================================
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS
//
//  The network panel used to count seeds among this node's peers, which can
//  never include the machine it runs on. Served from the France seed it saw
//  Singapore and nothing else, and the page said "WAM seed nodes: 1" -- read
//  by a visitor as a network with a single point of failure, when there are
//  two.
//
//  Relabelling it "other WAM seeds reached" made the number honest, and left
//  the question a visitor actually has unanswered: how many seeds does this
//  network have, and are they up?
//
//  So this asks DNS, which is the same thing a new node asks before it has
//  any peers at all. No self-knowledge is involved and nothing is guessed: a
//  seed either resolves and accepts a connection or it does not.
//
//  WHY THE ADDRESSES ARE COUNTED AND NOT THE NAMES
//
//  seed1, seed2 and seed3 all resolve to the same two machines today. Three
//  names on two hosts is not three seeds, and a page about decentralisation
//  that counted names would be flattering itself. Distinct addresses that
//  answer is the number that means something, and it becomes 3 on its own
//  the day a third machine exists -- no code changes.
//
//  NO ADDRESS IS EVER RETURNED. Only counts and, for our own seeds, the
//  country. A list of who runs a node is a list of who to attack.
// ===========================================================================
