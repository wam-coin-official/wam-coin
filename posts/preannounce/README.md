# The pre-launch announcement, 4 September 2026

Four drafts for four places, eleven days before mainnet. Nobody has posted
them yet; the founder posts by hand.

| File | Where | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `bitcointalk.txt` | [Altcoin Announcements](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0) | BBCode, one post |
| `telegram.txt` | [t.me/wam_coin_updates](https://t.me/wam_coin_updates) | English then Arabic |
| `discord.txt` | [discord.gg/Gxvmrjy9Qb](https://discord.gg/Gxvmrjy9Qb) | two messages, under the 2000 cap |
| `x.txt` | [x.com/WAMCoinCore](https://x.com/WAMCoinCore) | a thread of 9, plus an Arabic post |

Order matters a little: BitcoinTalk first, because it is the one that gets
replies and the one worth linking to from the others.

## What they claim, and where each number came from

Nothing in them is aspirational. Every figure was read out of the running
system on 4 September, not out of a document:

```
testnet height 5,136       wam-cli -testnet getblockchaininfo
independent nodes: 1       getpeerinfo, minus our own two seeds and the
                           founder's own line
premine 5 x 400,000        wam-params.h, WAM_PREMINE_UNLOCK_TIMES
unlocks 2027..2031         the same array, as calendar dates
fingerprint                SECURITY.md, and scripts/verify_release.sh
SLIP-44 5718349            satoshilabs/slips PR #2051, merged 2026-08-26
release assets             the GitHub API, not the packaging script
```

**One node, not two.** A second operator ran a node for several days and
left; the France node still retries the address every ten minutes, which
reads like a live peer in the logs and is not one — `lastseen=116.5hrs` at
the time of writing. The drafts say one because one is true.

**No countries, no addresses, no operator names.** One operator per country
means naming a country names the person to anyone who can watch the network,
and none of them agreed to be mentioned. A count is the most that can be
published.

## What writing them found

The verify command was going to be published broken.

`scripts/verify_release.sh` resolved its own location with `dirname "$0"`
*after* `cd`-ing into the download directory. `$0` is a relative path for
anybody who is not standing in the repo, so `SIGNING-KEY.asc` beside the
script was never found, the fallback to the reader's own keyring was taken,
and a reader who had imported nothing was told:

```
FAIL  the signature over SHA256SUMS is NOT valid
```

about a release that is perfectly good. That is the worst thing this script
can do — accuse an honest release, at the moment a stranger is deciding
whether to trust us, and do it to every first-time reader.

It was invisible because every test ran from inside the repo, where the
relative path happens to resolve. Found by running the published command as
a stranger would: clean directory, empty keyring, nothing cloned but what
the announcement says to clone.

Fixed by resolving the script's own directory to an absolute path before the
`cd`, and proved on a clean machine: the failing case now exits 0, the
in-repo case still exits 0, and the keyring was confirmed empty so no key
was quietly borrowed from a previous run.

## What is still missing from the release page

`SIGNING-KEY.asc` and `verify_release.sh` are not release assets — only the
tarballs, `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` are. The drafts work around it
by telling the reader to clone, which is arguably better anyway: the key
then comes from a different place than the binary it vouches for.

Worth deciding before launch whether the launch-day release should attach
them as well.

Note also that `v0.1.6` is marked **pre-release**, so GitHub's
`/releases/latest` skips it silently. Every draft links the tag directly.
