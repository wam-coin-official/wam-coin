# v0.1.8 — Windows and macOS, 12 September 2026

Four drafts for four places. **Nobody has posted them; the founder posts by
hand.** Sparks60 asked for Windows and macOS in Discord, so that draft
answers him by name, in the thread where he asked.

| File | Where | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `bitcointalk.txt` | the existing WAM topic in [Altcoin Announcements](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0) | BBCode, one reply |
| `telegram.txt` | [t.me/wam_coin_updates](https://t.me/wam_coin_updates) | English, then Arabic |
| `discord.txt` | [discord.gg/Gxvmrjy9Qb](https://discord.gg/Gxvmrjy9Qb) | three messages, each under the 2000 cap |
| `x.txt` | [x.com/WAMCoinCore](https://x.com/WAMCoinCore) | a thread of 8, plus two Arabic posts |

Post BitcoinTalk first. It is the one that gets replies and the one the
others can link to.

## Every figure, and where it was read from

Nothing here is aspirational. Each number was read out of the running system
on 12 September, and each can be re-read:

```
heights 0, 1, 5000, 6000   scripts/test/test_platform_consensus.sh, the gate
                           in .github/workflows/platform-build.yml
10 accepted, 0 rejected    the miner's own stats line, Windows 11
block 8478                 the pool journal on the France host:
                           "BLOCK CANDIDATE at height 8478 by ...win11"
                           then "BLOCK 8478 ACCEPTED"
Bearfoos.A!ml              Get-MpThreatDetection, ThreatID 2147731250,
                           02:53:21 local, fourteen seconds into the run
six release assets         the GitHub API, not the packaging script
the correction             measured by downloading the page from a seed
                           with the CDN cache bypassed: BADSIG, then GOODSIG
```

## What the posts do not say

**No countries, no addresses, no operator names.** One operator per country
means naming a country names the person, to anyone who can watch the
network, and none of them agreed to be named. That rule has not changed.

**No hashrate at all, ours or the network's.** The drafts first quoted this
machine's rate beside the block it found, which is worse than quoting the
network total: the two together are the arithmetic an attacker performs, and
we would have done it for him. `docs/ROADMAP.md` section 5.0 sets out that
comparison once, deliberately, and it does not need repeating in a post.

What survives is the part that proves the port rather than the strength:
shares accepted with none rejected, and a block the network took. Neither
tells a reader how much work the chain is defended by.

**No monitoring intervals.** An earlier draft named the cadence at which the
release is re-checked. That tells anybody who substitutes a file exactly how
long they have before anyone notices, and this file is as public as the post
was going to be, so the number is not here either. The draft says it is
watched from more than one machine, which is the part a reader needs.

**Nothing that ages.** No countdown, no "in three days". The date says the
same thing and stays true. The chain height moves every two minutes, so no
post quotes a current height — 8478 is quoted as the block the miner found,
which is a fixed historical fact, not a status.

## The correction is in three of the four

It would have been easy to leave out. For about seven hours the release page
served a checksum list that did not match its own signature, so a stranger
following our own instructions was told the signature was invalid about a
release that was fine — which is the worst sentence this project can put in
front of somebody deciding whether to trust it.

Anyone who checked in that window and walked away is owed the correction,
and they are exactly the people careful enough to have checked. Saying it
costs a paragraph; not saying it means a person who did the right thing is
left believing we shipped a forged file.

It is not in `x.txt`. A thread of eight is not where a seven-hour signature
fault gets explained properly, and a half-explanation there would read as
either a boast or an alarm. The three places that carry it are the three
where the full reason fits.

## Never write a bare filename that ends in a TLD

`scripts/check_post_text.py` enforces this and it runs in the sweep. The
same fault reached an operator alarm on 12 September -- "the key in
SECURITY.md", which Telegram turned into a link to a Moldovan shop -- so
there is now a matching check for alert text in
`scripts/test/test_alert_text.py`. Two checks because they read different
files, not because the rule differs.

Every reference in these drafts is a full `https://` URL.
