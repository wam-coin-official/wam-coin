#  check_visitors.py -- who tried to join, and why they did not stay
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_visitors.py --host <node> --network testnet
#      python3 scripts/check_visitors.py --host <node> --hours 48
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A stranger connected to the testnet three times across three days, stayed
#  about a quarter of an hour each time, and left. Nothing anywhere could say
#  whether he chose to go or whether our node dropped him.
#
#  The founder put the reason for caring better than the diagnosis did:
#
#      some of them will not know how to run it, and we would never hear.
#      If we knew why they failed we could guide them in the channels.
#
#  That is the difference between watching for a defect in our software and
#  watching for a person who needed one sentence of help and did not get it.
#  Somebody whose node fails does not open an issue. They close the terminal.
#
#  WHAT IT CANNOT SEE
#
#  Anyone who never reached us at all. A closed port on their side, a wrong
#  address, a build that would not compile -- none of it appears here,
#  because none of it ever touched this node. This shows the ones who got
#  close enough to knock.
#
#  IT NEEDS net LOGGING ON
#
#      wam-cli -testnet logging '["net"]'      # on, no restart needed
#      wam-cli -testnet logging '[]' '["net"]' # off again
#
#  Without it the node records nothing about connections and this reports
#  that it could not answer -- which is not the same as nobody having come.
#
#  NO ADDRESSES ARE PRINTED, EVER
#
#  Peers are named by country when we already know them and "a visitor"
#  otherwise. A list of who runs a node is a list of who to attack, and that
#  rule does not bend because the output is convenient.
