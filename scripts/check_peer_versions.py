#  check_peer_versions.py -- who on this network will be left behind?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_peer_versions.py --node HOST [--network testnet]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  v0.1.5 changed the mainnet treasury address, which is a consensus rule. A
#  node still on v0.1.4 when mainnet opens will reject every valid block and
#  fork itself off at height 1.
#
#  Its operator is not left completely blind -- Core raises
#  LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN once the rejected chain is about six blocks of
#  work ahead, roughly twelve minutes in at this chain's spacing, and says
#  "We do not appear to fully agree with our peers". But that warning lives
#  in the log and in getnetworkinfo, our release ships without a GUI, and
#  nobody watches a node that has been quietly working for a week.
#
#  There is no way to message a peer. The protocol carries blocks and
#  transactions, not notices. What is possible is to KNOW: to see, before
#  launch day rather than after it, how many independent operators are still
#  on a version that will be rejected, so the announcement can be repeated
#  while it can still do some good.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
#  It does not print addresses. Running a node is a favour to this project,
#  and a list of who does it is a list of who to attack. Counts and versions
#  only, and country only where the operator's own node already announces it
#  in public DNS -- which is to say, our own seeds.
