#      bash verify.sh
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  gen_founder_key.py reads the key with getpass, which hides what is typed.
#  On the ceremony console the input also arrived short, by a different
#  amount every time -- 35, 37, 39, 42 characters out of 52 -- with nothing
#  on screen to show it. The founder spent two days re-checking handwriting
#  that had been correct from the first attempt, twice, with a second person
#  reading each character aloud.
#
#  Hiding the input defends against someone reading the screen. On an
#  air-gapped machine in a locked room there is nobody, so the defence buys
#  nothing, and it removed the only feedback there was. A tool that cannot
#  be used correctly is not secure. It is abandoned, or worked around.
#
#  This reads with the shell instead, shows every character, and counts them
#  before anything else can go wrong. Nothing is written to disk.
