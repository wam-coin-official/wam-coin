#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Two checks cannot run on the founder's Windows machine, which is the machine
#  the sweep is actually run from:
#
#      check_dns_seeds.sh    needs dig
#      check_isa_baseline.sh needs objdump
#
#  Both said so honestly and exited 3. Their callers then reported the
#  unmeasured thing as a finding -- "seeding could not be checked at all" in
#  red, and "the published binaries carry instructions many CPUs do not have"
#  about binaries that are, in fact, clean. Those callers are fixed. But a
#  check that is permanently "not run" on the only machine anyone runs it from
#  is a check the project does not have, and DNS seeding is the thing that
#  decides whether a stranger can find the network at all on launch day.
#
#  Installing Windows ports of dig and objdump is the obvious answer and the
#  worse one. It fixes one laptop, the Windows builds lag, and the whole class
#  of fault chased on 5 September was a tool that answered to the right name
#  and was not the right tool.
#
#  We already own two Linux machines that have both, that the sweep already
#  talks to, and whose SSH access is already required for half the checks
#  above this one. So the check goes to the tool rather than the tool coming
#  to the check.
#
#  IT RUNS THE REPOSITORY'S OWN COPY, NOT A SHIPPED SCRIPT
#
#  The first version piped the local script in over `bash -s`. That sends the
#  code and not the context, and check_dns_seeds.sh reads the seed names out
#  of src/wam/chainparams.cpp -- so it arrived with no working tree, parsed
#  nothing, and announced "no seed was checked". A check that reports a
#  failure because of how it was invoked is the same disease as the four fixed
#  the same afternoon, introduced while fixing them.
#
#  The hosts already hold the repository at /opt/wam, and deploy.sh keeps it
#  at origin/main. So the remote runs ITS OWN checkout, and the commit is
#  compared first: an answer from different source is an answer to a different
#  question, and it must say so rather than pass quietly.
#
#  A check that needs a local artifact -- a tarball unpacked in a temp
#  directory here -- still cannot be moved this way, and must not pretend to
#  be. check_isa_baseline.sh is that case; its caller re-fetches the published
#  release on the remote host instead, which asks the same question where the
#  answer lives.

#
# Runs that script from the host's own checkout and exits with its status.
# Never returns on success -- it redirects the whole run.
run_elsewhere() {

    # A remote run must never bounce onward. If the tool is missing THERE too,
    # the honest answer is exit 3, not another hop.
