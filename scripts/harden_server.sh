#  harden_server.sh -- prepare a fresh Ubuntu box to hold a pool wallet
# ===========================================================================
#
#      sudo bash scripts/harden_server.sh --network testnet
#
#  install.sh builds and installs WAM. It does nothing about the machine it
#  installs onto, and that machine will eventually hold the private key to a
#  pool wallet with other people's money in it.
#
#  THE TWO THAT MATTER MOST
#
#  Everything below is ordinary hardening except two rules, and those two are
#  the reason this script exists:
#
#      the RPC port must never be reachable from the internet
#      Redis must never be reachable from the internet
#
#  An open RPC port is the wallet. An open Redis is every miner's balance.
#  Both listen on localhost by default and both have been exposed by
#  accident on thousands of machines, always the same way: someone changed a
#  bind address for a second host and did not think about the firewall.
#
#  NOTHING HERE CAN LOCK YOU OUT
#
#  The dangerous step is disabling password logins over SSH. Done in the wrong
#  order it ends with an operator who cannot reach their own server. So it is
#  refused unless a usable key is already installed, and it is verified after
#  the fact rather than assumed. If anything is uncertain the script stops and
#  says what to do, leaving SSH exactly as it found it.

# What sshd will actually run with, for one keyword.
#
# The obvious form is `sshd -T | awk '/^key /{print $2; exit}'`. Do not use it.
# awk's `exit` closes the pipe while sshd is still writing, sshd dies of
# SIGPIPE, and `set -o pipefail` turns the whole pipeline into status 141.
# `set -e` then aborts at the assignment -- with no message, because a failed
# assignment prints nothing.
#
# That is not hypothetical. It is why this script wrote its SSH hardening,
# never verified it, never reloaded, and exited looking successful. And it is a
# race: the same line survives when the producer happens to finish first, so it
# fails on one machine and not the next.
#
# Reading to END cannot race. sshd -T is a few kilobytes; there is nothing to
# save by stopping early.
