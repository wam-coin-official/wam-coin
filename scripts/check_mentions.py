#  check_mentions.py -- can a check here be fired by text that merely
#                       mentions what it looks for?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_mentions.py
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A check that matches text cannot tell use from mention. A file documenting
#  a rule contains the words of the rule, and the check enforcing the rule
#  finds them. Between 5 and 6 September 2026 that happened four times:
#
#    - release.yml hoisted a `MANDATORY:` line out of a commit message that
#      was *explaining the MANDATORY convention*, and every channel was told
#      a release changing nothing was UPDATE REQUIRED.
#
#    - set_version.py rewrote a version inside a quotation whose whole point
#      was naming the old version, producing a path that never existed.
#
#    - check_consensus_final.sh flagged the comment explaining why
#      placeholders had been removed. That was answered by narrowing the
#      pattern, which moved the blind spot instead of closing it.
#
#    - a guard refusing to install a systemd unit that still passed
#      -rpcpassword matched the comment describing the flag it no longer
#      passes, and so refused to install the fix.
#
#  Four sites, four separate repairs, and the fifth was going to be somewhere
#  nobody had looked. The fault was never in those checks. It was that a
#  writer had no way to say "this text is a quotation", so every check had to
#  guess, and each guessed differently.
#
#  scripts/lib/quoted.py and its shell twin are that way. This file is what
#  keeps them from becoming another thing three scripts use and the fourth
#  does not: any check that reads tracked files and matches patterns in them
#  must honour the marks, or be listed below with a reason a person wrote.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
#  Prove a check is correct. It proves each scanner has been *considered* --
#  that somebody decided, and left the decision where the next person finds
#  it. The behaviour itself is proved in each check, by planting the marker
#  quoted and unquoted and watching it pass and fail.
