WHY THIS EXISTS

On 12 September 2026 v0.1.8 was published. It was the first release carrying
Windows archives, and those are attached to the page by hand: SHA256SUMS.asc
was uploaded and SHA256SUMS was not replaced, so the signature covered a
four-line list while the page still served the runner's two-line one.

Anyone following this project's own instructions was told:

    FAIL  the signature over SHA256SUMS is NOT valid
          SHA256SUMS was changed after it was signed, or the signature is not
          ours. Do not run the binaries.

That is the verifier working exactly as designed, and it is the worst sentence
a coin project can put in front of a stranger deciding whether to trust it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT

It is not a new check. check_release_signed.sh has asked this question since
the day it was written, and its header has always said why:

    Everything else here can be true while the published release is not. The
    signing key can be present, package_release.sh can sign correctly, the
    local files can verify perfectly -- and the asset uploaded to GitHub two
    weeks ago can still be the unsigned one, because uploading is a manual
    step and manual steps get half-done.

The check was right, was written down, and ran only when a person happened to
run the sweep. Nothing asked it at the moment it mattered. This is the timer
that asks.

The announcement bot now refuses to speak about a release that does not
verify, which stops the public being pointed at a broken page. This is the
other half: it catches a release that was ALREADY announced, or was published
before the gate existed, or broke afterwards because somebody re-uploaded an
asset. On the night of 15 September the mainnet release is assembled by hand
the same way, and ten minutes is how long a mistake should be allowed to live.

WHY IT WILL NOT CRY WOLF

It alarms once, when the answer changes to "does not verify", and says so once
more when it recovers -- because the France rehearsal on 11 September proved
that the missing half of an alert is not "something broke" but "it is over".

Exit 2 from the check means the question could not be asked: no gpg, no curl,
GitHub unreachable. That is neither a pass nor a finding. It is reported and
nothing is sent, and the question is asked again on the next run.
