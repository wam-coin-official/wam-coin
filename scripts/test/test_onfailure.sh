#
#  Three services in this project have failed and stayed failed while every
#  panel showed green:
#
#    wam-backup            from 23 August 2026, nightly, and there was
#                          nothing to restore from
#    wam-reorg-watch       France 03:11 UTC and Singapore 03:47 UTC on
#                          1 September 2026, for ten and a half hours
#
#  Each was found by a person going and looking. The cause was the same each
#  time: the panels read `systemctl is-active` on the TIMER, and a timer
#  stays active however often the service beneath it fails.
#
#  OnFailure=wam-alert@%n.service is what closes that. This test exists so
#  that the next unit added to deploy/systemd cannot quietly be the one that
#  goes back to failing in silence.
