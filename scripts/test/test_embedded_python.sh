#  test_embedded_python.sh -- does the Python inside our shell scripts parse?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/test/test_embedded_python.sh
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  scripts/prepare_listing_pr.sh carried a heredoc whose indentation had been
#  lost:
#
# wam:quote-begin
#      if any(x.get("ticker") == entry["ticker"] for x in data):
#      print("  ok     manifest already lists %s" % entry["ticker"])
#      else:
# wam:quote-end
#
#  It sat in the repository, committed, through every sweep. Nothing runs a
#  heredoc until the branch that reaches it runs, and that branch is the one
#  that submits this coin to an exchange. It failed on 6 September in the
#  middle of updating a live pull request, with an IndentationError as the
#  only explanation.
#
#  A shell script's syntax is checked by `bash -n`. The Python inside it is
#  checked by nobody, and it is the part most likely to be edited by whoever
#  is in a hurry.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH
#
#  Whether the code is right. Only whether it is code. That is still the
#  difference between a fault found now and a fault found while pushing to
#  somebody else's repository.
