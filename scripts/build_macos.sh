#  build_macos.sh -- build the node on macOS, natively
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/fetch-upstream.sh          # fetch and patch Core first
#      bash scripts/build_macos.sh
#
#  WHY NATIVE AND NOT CROSS-COMPILED
#
#  Upstream supports cross-compiling for macOS from Linux, and it needs the
#  macOS SDK extracted from Xcode 15, downloaded with an Apple account, under
#  a licence that lets nobody redistribute it. That is a real cost and it was
#  the reason macOS was put behind Windows in docs/ROADMAP.md §7.
#
#  The second reason given there was worse and was wrong: that nobody here has
#  a Mac to test on. GitHub's hosted runners include real macOS machines, free
#  for public repositories, and this repository is public. So the build is
#  native -- Xcode is already there, no SDK is extracted and no licence
#  question arises -- and the same runner can RUN what it built and sync the
#  chain. The test that was called impossible is the cheaper half.
#
#  TWO MACS, NOT ONE
#
#  Every Mac sold since 2020 is arm64 and everything before it is x86_64, and
#  a binary for one does not run on the other. This script builds for whatever
#  it is running on and says which, so the two runners produce two artifacts
#  that are labelled rather than two files with the same name.
#
#  ARCH FOR RANDOMX, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION ON ARM
#
#  scripts/fetch-upstream.sh passes ARCH=x86-64 to RandomX, never native,
#  because a release built with native carried 746 AVX-512 instructions and
#  died with SIGILL on a CPU without them.
#
#  ARCH is an x86 option. Passing x86-64 on Apple Silicon is meaningless at
#  best, so this passes it only on an Intel Mac and lets RandomX decide on
#  arm64 -- and never passes native anywhere. The Apple Silicon baseline is a
#  real question that this does not answer: check_isa_baseline.sh now says so
#  out loud instead of reporting an arm64 binary as within an x86-64 baseline.

# version, discovered by building against whatever a package manager happened
# to have that day.
#
# depends is upstream's answer and it is already how the Windows build here
# works: it fetches and builds the versions Core expects -- boost 1.81.0 --
# so the result does not depend on what Homebrew shipped this week. That makes
# the two platforms consistent rather than each carrying its own accident.
#
# No SDK question arises. depends/README.md lists the macOS SDK under "For
# macOS CROSS compilation", which is building for darwin from Linux. This runs
