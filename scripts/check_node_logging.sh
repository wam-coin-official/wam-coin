#      bash scripts/check_node_logging.sh 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8
#
#  WHY
#
#  On 2 September 2026 unattended-upgrades replaced libevent, which wamd links
#  against, and restarted the node at 06:23 UTC. The restart was correct and
#  the node came back healthy. What did not come back was `debug=net`, because
#  it had been turned on at run time and was never written into wam.conf.
#
#  From that moment the node still knew who was connected THIS SECOND, and had
#  no memory of anyone who connected and left. A French address touched the
#  P2P port at 05:29 -- fifty-four minutes before the blindness -- and the only
#  reason we could say whether it was an operator or a port scanner is that it
#  arrived while the log was still running. An hour later the same event would
#  have left nothing at all.
#
#  The founder asks "who joined, and from which country" more often than he
#  asks anything else. This check exists so that the answer to that question
#  cannot go missing quietly again.
#
#  It asks two things, because either alone is a false pass:
#
#    * is the category on RIGHT NOW        -- run-time state
#    * is it in wam.conf                   -- will it survive the next restart
#
#  A node with it on but not in the conf is exactly the state that produced
#  the blindness, and it looks perfectly healthy from the outside.
# ===========================================================================
