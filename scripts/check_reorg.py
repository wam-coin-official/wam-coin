#  check_reorg.py -- did a block that was confirmed stop being confirmed?
# ===========================================================================
#

#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A new proof-of-work chain is cheap to reorganise, and WAM is a RandomX
#  chain, which means the hardware that attacks it is CPU -- the most
#  rentable resource there is. Monero is safe because its hashrate is
#  enormous. A chain in its first weeks is not Monero.
#
#  What that attack actually does is narrow, and worth stating precisely
#  because the fear is usually aimed at the wrong thing: it does not touch
#  anybody's wallet and it cannot move coins the attacker does not own. It
#  lets the attacker spend their own coins twice -- deposit somewhere, take
#  the value out, then publish a longer chain in which the deposit never
#  happened. The victim is whoever accepted the payment on few
#  confirmations. Almost always an exchange.
#
#  There is no way to make that impossible for a young chain. There is a way
#  to not be the last to know. A reorganisation is visible from any node the
#  moment it lands, and the difference between hearing about it in four
#  minutes and hearing about it in four days is the difference between one
#  exchange losing one deposit and every exchange delisting.
#
#  So this asks two questions, and they catch different things:
#
#    1. Is there a competing branch, and how deep?  getchaintips shows
#       branches the node knows about but has not switched to. An attacker
#       who mined in private and then published shows up here at full depth
#       BEFORE the node reorganises onto it, if we are quick. This is the
#       early warning.
#
#    2. Has a hash we recorded at a given height changed?  This is the
#       proof. A branch can be pruned and forgotten; a block that used to be
#       at height 3,600 and is not there any more cannot be explained away.
#       Nothing else in our checks would notice it.
#
#  CALIBRATION, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED
#
#  On 2026-08-29, with 3,608 blocks of testnet behind us, the deepest side
#  branch the node had ever held was ONE block, and there were three of
#  them, all valid-headers -- headers received for blocks we never fetched.
#  That is ordinary and happens on every chain.
#
#  So depth 1 is noise. The default alarm is 2, which on this chain's own
#  history has never happened. An alarm that fires weekly is an alarm nobody
#  reads, and an alarm that has never fired is one people believe.
