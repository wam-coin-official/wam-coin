#  check_admin_keys.sh -- who can become root on each machine?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/check_admin_keys.sh HOST [HOST...]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 18 September 2026 two entries on the operations panel had been yellow
#  for days:
#
#      nodes agree                    unknown   13.140.33.187 could not be read
#      deployed code is origin/main   unknown   13.140.33.187 could not be read
#
#  The host was healthy and answered by hand in three seconds. The cause was
#  one line out of `ssh -v`: the panel spawned its shell checks through the
#  `bash` on the Windows PATH, which is the WSL launcher, and WSL is a
#  separate machine with its own ~/.ssh. It offered
#  wam.coin.official@proton.me. France and Singapore authorise that key.
#  US-east, added on 16 September, does not.
#
#  Nothing could have found that by looking at the host, and nothing in this
#  repository knew which machine trusted which key. On a network that holds
#  money, the question "who can become root here" had no instrument.
#
#  IT COMPARES ONLY THE KEYS THAT GET A SHELL
#
#  The first version of this file compared the whole of authorized_keys and
#  took the commonest set as the baseline. With three hosts holding three
#  different sets there is no commonest set, so it picked the first and
#  reported Singapore as wrong for holding report@france -- a key Singapore
#  is SUPPOSED to hold, because the daily report reads its facts through it.
#  A check that calls a correct configuration a failure is worse than none.
#
#  A key pinned to a forced command cannot become root: it runs one program
#  and exits, so it belongs to its job and lives on exactly the hosts that
#  job touches. Those are listed with the command they are pinned to, and
#  never compared. What is compared is the keys that get a shell.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
#  It does not add, remove or copy a key, and it never will: this file reads.
#  Fingerprints and comments only -- no key material is printed, because a
#  check's output ends up in a terminal, a screenshot and a log.
#
#  EXIT CODES, this project's convention
#
#      0  every host gives a shell to the same keys
#      1  they do not agree on who can become root
#      2  fewer than two hosts could be read, so nothing was compared
