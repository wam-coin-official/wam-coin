#                                          |  the second disk

#
#  Git Bash, not PowerShell. PowerShell has no gpg on PATH; the one that works
#  is C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\gpg.exe, which is what Git Bash runs.
#
#  WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT THREE cp COMMANDS
#
#  Everything this project publishes is trusted because of one key. There is
#  one copy of it, on one USB stick, and a USB stick is a consumer flash chip
#  in a plastic shell. If it dies the day after launch, every future release
#  is unsignable, the fingerprint in SECURITY.md becomes a promise nothing can
#  keep, and the only honest recovery is to publish a new key and ask several
#  thousand strangers to believe that the people asking them to trust a new
#  fingerprint are the same people as before. There is no good version of that
#  conversation.
#
#  And a copy is worth what it can be proved to do. `cp` produces a file. What
#  matters is whether GnuPG can still read it and whether it can still sign,
#  and those are different questions with different failure modes: a truncated
#  copy imports and cannot sign; a copy whose passphrase has been misremembered
#  imports, is the right key by fingerprint, and is useless. pull_backups.sh
#  already carries this lesson in its own header -- "a second copy of a file on
#  a disk that is about to fail" -- and the France rehearsal on 11 September
#  made the general version of it plain: a safeguard nobody has watched work is
#  a safeguard nobody can vouch for.
#
#  So this copies, compares byte for byte, imports the COPY into a throwaway
#  keyring, checks it against the fingerprint published in SECURITY.md, and
#  then asks it to sign something. The signature is verified against the public
#  SIGNING-KEY.asc from this repository -- which is what a stranger verifying a
#  release actually uses -- so a pass here means the copy can do the job the
#  original does, and not merely that a file arrived.
#
#  WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
#
#  It never writes the secret key, or a keyring holding it, to the internal
#  disk. The throwaway GNUPGHOME is created on the destination disk and
#  destroyed on exit, the same way sign_release.sh puts its keyring on the USB.
#  A secret key that has touched C:\ has touched the disk that leaves the house
#  inside the laptop and the disk that a backup agent, a sync client or a
#  malware scanner uploads.
#
#  It never asks for, prints, stores or logs the passphrase. GnuPG prompts for
#  it directly, once, when the test signature is made.
#
#  It refuses to write to the system drive at all, for the same reason.

WAM Coin -- release signing key, second copy
Made $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC') by scripts/backup_signing_key.sh

WHAT THESE FILES ARE

  $SECRET
      The private key that signs every WAM Coin release and the signed
      channel list. It is encrypted with a passphrase that is NOT written
      down anywhere on this disk, and must not be.

  $REVOKE
      The revocation certificate. Publishing it tells the world that the
      key above must no longer be trusted. Use it if the key is lost,
      copied by somebody else, or if you believe either may have happened.
      It cannot be regenerated without the key.

  SIGNING-KEY.asc
      The PUBLIC half. Not secret. Here so that a release can be verified
      on a machine with no internet.

THE FINGERPRINT, which is the only thing that identifies the real key:

  4BD4 A8D3 AFD4 3F5C BCB5  00E2 3798 462F E00A DBA4

It is published in SECURITY.md at
https://github.com/wam-coin-official/wam-coin -- and nowhere else. Anything
claiming a different fingerprint for WAM Coin is not WAM Coin.

THE ONE RULE

  This disk does not go into a computer that is connected to the internet,
  except for the moment a release is being signed, and not at all if that
  can be avoided. A secret key is only secret while the number of places
  it has been is small enough to count.

IF YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE THE OTHER COPY DIED

  Plug this disk in, and use it exactly as the USB was used:

      bash scripts/sign_release.sh <directory of downloads> <this drive>

  sign_release.sh expects $SECRET at the root of the drive it is
  given, so copy it up one level first, or pass this folder as the drive.
  Then make a third copy before doing anything else, with
  scripts/backup_signing_key.sh -- you are now back to one.
