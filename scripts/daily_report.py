#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Everything else here writes into a journal or a file on a server. That is
#  fine while somebody is looking, and the failures that hurt are precisely
#  the ones nobody is looking at: the nightly backup died on both machines
#  on 23 August and stayed dead until the 26th, while the timer stayed green
#  and the sweep reported 21 passed.
#
#  A dashboard does not fix that either, because a dashboard also waits to
#  be opened. What was missing is something that arrives.
#
#  WHAT STOPS IT LYING
#
#  The founder's objection, in his words: "the report sometimes lies". A
#  green message over a broken system is worse than none, because it buys
#  calm that was not earned.
#
#    1. A SEQUENCE NUMBER. If #12 arrives and then #14, report #13 never
#       came -- the machine that sends them was down, and the gap is the
#       alarm. Silence is the one failure a monitor cannot report on its
#       own, and numbering is what makes silence visible.
#    2. AGES, NOT ADJECTIVES. Not "backups ok" but "backup 6h". A value
#       whose age is hidden cannot be judged.
#    3. COULD-NOT-CHECK IS ITS OWN WORD, listed separately from passes and
#       failures, because counting it as either is a lie in one direction.
#    4. IT SAYS WHAT IT CANNOT SEE FROM HERE. This runs on one server, and
#       several checks need a workstation with keys to every host. Rather
#       than pretend those passed, it names them and says where they are
#       run.
#
#  HOW IT READS THE OTHER MACHINE
#
#  Not with a general ssh key. France holds a key that Singapore accepts
#  only with a forced command -- /usr/local/bin/wam-facts, which prints
#  status and changes nothing. Asked for a shell, or for /etc/shadow, sshd
#  ignores the request and runs the facts script instead; that was tested
#  rather than assumed. If France is ever taken, what that key grants on
#  Singapore is the ability to read a status line.
#
#  It goes to one private chat, never to the announcement channel. An
#  operations report names the weakest machine and the unwatched hour, and
#  that is a map for whoever wants to attack this network.
