#  WHY IT IS ONE PLACE
#
#  Delivery has two rules that are easy to get wrong twice. First, a host
#  without a bot token must not be given one -- whoever took that machine
#  could otherwise post to the public announcement channel in the founder's
#  name -- so its alarms are parked in a file that the host holding the token
#  reads and forwards. Second, the parked file must be capped, because the
#  forwarding host dedupes by hash and cannot write an acknowledgement back
#  through a key that runs one read-only command.
#
#  Both rules were written into the login watcher first. The second thing
#  that needed to raise an alarm would have copied them, and a copy is where
#  the two versions start to differ.

# day's own testing -- and the ONLY thing preventing them being sent again was
# a state file on France. Lose that file, or rebuild that machine, and

# An alarm nobody forwarded within a day is not going to be forwarded, and one
# that was forwarded has already done its work. Either way it should go.

def maintenance():
    """The open maintenance window, if there is one and it has not expired.

    NOTHING IS EVER SILENCED BY IT. It only adds a label.

    The first design of this suppressed alarms during planned work, because
    rebooting both servers on 2 September raised two perfectly correct alarms
    that were both mine -- a check that could not reach a node I had stopped,
    and a machine whose ports "were closed before" because it had just come
    back.

    The founder rejected suppression, and his reason is the right one: a
    switch that silences the alarms is the first thing an intruder would want,
    and an intrusion that happens to land inside a window we opened ourselves
    would arrive as silence. The noise is the smaller problem. He knows when
    he is doing maintenance; he cannot know when somebody else is.

    So the window answers "was this expected?" and never "should this be
    sent?". Every alarm still leaves the machine. The label is there so a
    person can see at a glance which ones were us -- and, more usefully, which
    ones were not.

    It still carries an absolute expiry, so a forgotten window stops labelling
    on its own rather than mislabelling a real fault as routine next week.
