#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  v0.1.8 is the first release with Windows downloads, and the verifier that
#  has guarded every release until now is a bash script. A Windows user who
#  installed no Linux -- which is the entire audience the Windows build was
#  added for -- cannot run it.
#
#  What docs/MINE.md told them to do instead was
#
#      certutil -hashfile wam-coin-...zip SHA256
#      type SHA256SUMS
#
#  and compare sixty-four hexadecimal characters by eye. People do not do
#  that. They glance at the first four characters and the last four, which is
#  the check an attacker would design for, or they skip it, which is what the
#  whole discipline exists to prevent. Verification that is tedious is
#  verification that does not happen, and this project has said in five places
#  that the signature is the one step that cannot be checked afterwards.
#
#  WHAT IT REFUSES TO SAY
#
#  The same three things as the bash version, and it prints ok only if all
#  three hold: the signature over SHA256SUMS is good, it was made by the
#  fingerprint published in SECURITY.md, and the file in front of you is a
#  file that signature covers.
#
#  Windows ships no gpg. If none is found this reports what the hashes did --
#  which is worth knowing -- and then exits 2, the convention in this project
#  for "the check could not run". It does not print a pass. A matching hash
#  against an unsigned list proves the download is not corrupt and proves
#  nothing about who wrote the list: whoever can replace the archive can
#  replace SHA256SUMS beside it, and the two will agree perfectly.

# Run gpg, keep its stdout, and put its stderr in a file.
#
# Three ways to do this are wrong, and each was tried:
#
#   * a bare call prints gpg's own
#         gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
#     straight at somebody verifying a download for the first time. That
#     warning is normal -- it means "you have not told GnuPG you trust this
#     key", which is true of everybody initially, and is the very question
#     this script answers by comparing the fingerprint. The bash version hides
#     it for the same reason and gives its own verdict.
#
#   * `2>&1` merges stderr into stdout, and PowerShell 5.1 wraps each of those
#     lines in an ErrorRecord: a good signature came out of an earlier version
#     of this file as a NativeCommandError raised inside its own cleanup.
#
#   * Start-Process -Wait with redirected streams HANGS on the MSYS gpg that
#     Git for Windows ships. gpg starts gpg-agent, the agent inherits the
#     redirected handle and outlives gpg, and -Wait never returns. It hung for
#     five minutes on a release that was perfectly valid.
#
# So: stderr to a file with a plain redirect, stdout captured as the value,
# and $LASTEXITCODE for the verdict -- not $?, which a redirected native
# stderr sets to false even on success.
