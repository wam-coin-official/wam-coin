#  check_deployed_code.sh -- is the running software this software?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/check_deployed_code.sh HOST [HOST...]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  check_nodes_agree.sh compares the node binaries, because two nodes with
#  different consensus rules split a chain. It says nothing about everything
#  else that is deployed from this repository -- the pool, the announcement
#  bot, the dashboard, the explorer -- and those drift the same way and are
#  noticed even later, because nothing they do stops.
#
#  On 2026-08-20 the checkout on the pool server was seven commits behind. One
#  of those commits fixed a release announcement arriving on Telegram with its
#  code fences showing as literal backticks. The fix was written, committed,
#  pushed and correct; the bot went on posting the old way, because nobody had
#  pulled. There was no error anywhere -- the wrong version of working software
#  produces no symptom a machine can see.
#
#  This compares the deployed checkout against origin/main, which is what a
#  reader of the repository believes is running.
#
#  AND: A HOST IT CANNOT REACH IS NOT A HOST THAT PASSES.
#
#  Until 2026-09-14 an unreachable server printed "note no checkout found" in
#  yellow and the summary under it still said "every deployed checkout is
#  origin/main", exit 0. So did a reachable server whose checkout lives
#  somewhere not listed in PATHS. Both are the same mistake: reporting that
#  nothing is wrong when the truth is that nothing was looked at. The panel
#  which reads this script paints exit 2 amber -- "unknown" -- for precisely
#  this case, so this script now says 2 instead of lying green.
