# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/apply_host_limits.sh                  # the three seeds
#      bash scripts/apply_host_limits.sh HOST [HOST...]
#      bash scripts/apply_host_limits.sh --show HOST      # read, change nothing
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  deploy/systemd carries MemoryMax=2G for the mainnet node and 4G for
#  ElectrumX. Those are sensible on a 12 GB machine and meaningless on the
#  Singapore seed, which has 1914 MB in total: a ceiling above the machine's
#  own memory bounds nothing at all.
#
#  So when memory runs short there, nothing we wrote decides anything. The
#  kernel's OOM killer decides, and it picks by size -- which means it picks
#  `wamd`, the largest process on the box at 580 MB. On launch night that is
#  the mainnet seed, and losing it is losing a third of the network's
#  visibility to anyone syncing from genesis.
#
#  The fix costs nothing and is not an upgrade: bound every service well
#  below total memory, and state the order of sacrifice ourselves.
#
#      testnet ElectrumX    +900   goes first, and nobody notices
#      testnet node         +700   testnet also runs on two other hosts
#      mainnet ElectrumX    +200   wallets lose one of two servers
#      mainnet node         -500   last, and only if nothing else is left
#
#  MEASURED, NOT GUESSED
#
#  The numbers come from what these services actually use:
#
#      wamd, testnet, dbcache=100     580 MB
#      electrumx, either network       50 MB   (its database is 3.2 MB)
#
#  An earlier plan for this file assumed ElectrumX wanted 300-500 MB and
#  concluded the small host needed replacing. It does not. Measuring first
#  turned a server purchase into four drop-in files.
#
#  MemoryHigh throttles and reclaims; MemoryMax kills. Setting High below
#  what a service genuinely needs causes constant reclaim -- slow, not
#  safe -- so each floor here sits above the measured figure with headroom.
