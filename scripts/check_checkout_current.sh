#  exit 0  this checkout builds the newest release, or the check could not
#          be made (no network, GitHub not answering) and said so
#  exit 1  this checkout is behind, and nothing in between changed consensus
#  exit 2  this checkout is behind a release that changed a consensus rule,
#          so the node it builds will be rejected by the network
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  install.sh builds whatever is in the clone it is run from, and never
#  asked whether that was still current. The explorer invites strangers with
#  one line -- "Run one yourself: ./install.sh --network testnet" -- so a
#  person who cloned the repository last week and ran it today silently got
#  last week's node.
#
#  On 26 August someone did exactly that and joined on v0.1.5, two releases
#  behind, stayed briefly and left. Nothing had gone wrong from their side.
#  We handed them a tool that builds the past without saying so.
#
#  The founder put the cost plainly: somebody running a withdrawn release
#  does not conclude "my copy is old". They conclude the system is broken,
#  and they do not come back. At the beginning, that is the whole cost.
#
#  And on 15 September it stops being about impressions. A clone taken
#  before the consensus release builds a node that is rejected at height 1
#  and is never told why -- the protocol carries blocks, not notices.
#
#  HOW IT DECIDES A RELEASE CHANGED CONSENSUS
#
#  By the MANDATORY: line in its notes. That marker is not decoration: the
#  release workflow refuses to publish a tag whose consensus values differ
#  from the previous tag unless it carries one. So "is there a MANDATORY
#  release newer than mine" is a question with a reliable answer, asked of
#  the server rather than of this clone -- which is the point, since a stale
#  clone's own tags are stale too.
