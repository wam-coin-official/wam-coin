#
#  Meant to be an ExecStartPre in the node unit, where a non-zero exit stops
#  the service before the daemon runs.
#
#  WHAT THIS PREVENTS
#
#  A node started before its genesis timestamp works exactly once. From an
#  empty datadir, genesis is constructed in memory and accepted; the node
#  reports height 0 and looks entirely healthy. Every start after that reads
#  genesis from disk instead, and startup verification refuses a stored block
#  dated ahead of now:
#
#      The block database contains a block which appears to be from the
#      future. Please restart with -reindex or -reindex-chainstate to
#      recover.
#      [error] Aborted block database rebuild. Exiting.
#
#  -reindex does not recover it either, because the block it would rebuild
#  from is the same block. The datadir has to be emptied.
#
#  So the failure is stored, not immediate. `systemctl start wamd-mainnet`
#  succeeds, and the node dies at the next reboot -- which, with
#  Restart=always, is a crash loop that begins at whatever hour the machine
#  happened to restart. Confirmed by doing it on 2026-08-28 and again on
#  2026-08-29.
#
#  The gate exists because "we know not to do that" is not a mechanism. On
#  29 August I started the mainnet node myself, on purpose, to test ElectrumX
#  against it -- and left a poisoned datadir behind. Knowing the rule did not
#  help; there was nothing to stop me.
#
#  EXIT 78, NOT 1
#
#  Restart=always restarts a unit whose ExecStartPre failed, so a plain
#  refusal became a retry every RestartSec seconds -- forty of them in ten
#  minutes on the France host, which is the crash loop this gate exists to
#  prevent, arriving by a different door. 78 is EX_CONFIG from sysexits.h,
#  and wamd-mainnet.service names it in RestartPreventExitStatus, so systemd
#  reports the failure once and stops.
#
#  DELIBERATE REHEARSAL
#
#      WAM_ALLOW_PRELAUNCH_START=1 systemctl start wamd-mainnet
#
#  which is allowed, warns, and is the only way past. Empty the datadir
#  afterwards or the next start fails.

  genesis_gate: $CHAIN opens $WHEN, in ${LEFT}h.

  $DATADIR already contains a block database, and it holds a
  genesis block dated in the future. This node cannot start, with or
  without an override, and -reindex will not help because it would rebuild
  from the same block.

      rm -rf $DATADIR/blocks $DATADIR/chainstate $DATADIR/indexes

  The wallet, the conf and everything else in that directory are untouched
  by those three removals.

  genesis_gate: allowing an early $CHAIN start because
  WAM_ALLOW_PRELAUNCH_START=1.

  This node will run once and will NOT survive a restart or a reboot. Empty
  its block database when you are finished:

      rm -rf ${DATADIR:-<datadir>}/blocks ${DATADIR:-<datadir>}/chainstate ${DATADIR:-<datadir>}/indexes

EOF
    exit 0
fi

cat >&2 <<EOF

  genesis_gate: refusing to start $CHAIN. It opens $WHEN,
  in ${LEFT}h.

  A node started now would work once and then fail at every restart, with an
  error about a block from the future -- most likely at a reboot nobody
  planned, on the night it mattered.

  If this is a deliberate rehearsal:

      WAM_ALLOW_PRELAUNCH_START=1 systemctl start <unit>

exit 78
