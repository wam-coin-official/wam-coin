#  check_min_chain_work.py -- is there a floor under what this node will follow?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_min_chain_work.py            # testnet
#      python3 scripts/check_min_chain_work.py --network mainnet
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  consensus.nMinimumChainWork is the least total work a chain must carry
#  before a node will follow it at all. Zero means "follow whoever shows me
#  the heaviest chain", and for a young network that is not theoretical.
#
#  On 6 September 2026 the test network carried 6.63 billion hashes of work
#  across 5,897 blocks. At the difficulty floor a block costs about 1.05
#  million hashes, so ten ordinary desktops rebuild the whole history from
#  genesis in under a day. A node syncing for the first time would follow
#  that history rather than this one -- it is heavier, and nothing in the
#  software said otherwise.
#
#  Mainnet launches on 15 September with zero work, so the value CANNOT be
#  set before launch. It has to be set afterwards, in the first release with
#  some depth behind it, and the only thing that would have made that happen
#  is somebody remembering. This project has established what happens to
#  things that depend on somebody remembering: a hand-kept file list went
#  stale three times, "four accounts" survived into a fifth, and two beginner
#  guides pointed at withdrawn binaries for two releases.
#
#  THE OTHER DIRECTION, WHICH IS WORSE
#
#  A value ABOVE the real chain's work stops new nodes syncing the real
#  chain. They wait for a heavier one, which never comes, and report nothing
#  more helpful than no progress. That failure looks like a network outage
#  and is one bad copy-paste away, so both directions are checked here
#  against a node that is actually running.
