WHY THIS EXISTS

On 11 September every WAM service on the France host was stopped for eight
minutes, deliberately, to answer a question the schedule had been carrying
since the 9th: does the network survive losing a seed?

The network survived. The telling did not. One alarm arrived and it said

    ALARM  wam-reorg-watch@testnet.service FAILED on vmi3500463

which is a helper script exiting non-zero, not a seed node dying, the
explorer and pool returning 502 to the public, and the chain producing
nothing for four block times. And every part of that alarm -- the watcher
that noticed, the unit that fired, the credentials it sent with -- was
running on the machine that had just died. It arrived because France was
alive enough to send it.

A power cut would have been silent. Singapore does not watch France. The new
seed watched nothing at all. The only thing looking at all three was the
operations panel on a laptop, which is not always on.

WHAT IT WATCHES, AND WHY IT NEEDS NO NEW ACCESS

Not SSH. France already holds a key Singapore accepts, and daily_report.py
says in writing why that is a risk worth naming: if France is taken, what
that key reaches goes with it. Adding two more such paths to make a watchdog
would be buying a smaller failure with a larger one.

It watches the peer list the node already has. Our seeds connect to each
other by `addnode`, so if Singapore is up, it is in France's getpeerinfo. If
it stops appearing there, France knows without asking anybody for anything.

That also makes the check honest about what it can see: it reports "I can no
longer see this host from here", which is true and useful, rather than "that
host is down", which no single machine can know.

WHY IT WILL NOT CRY WOLF

A peer connection drops for ordinary reasons -- a restart, a network blip, a
seed rotating its own connections. Alarming on the first miss would produce
noise, and a watcher that is usually wrong is a watcher nobody reads.

So it needs the same host missing on MISSES_BEFORE_ALARM consecutive runs
before it says anything, and it says it once. When the host comes back it
says that once too, with how long it was gone -- because the thing the France
rehearsal proved was missing is not only "something broke" but "it is over".
