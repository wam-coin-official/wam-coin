#  check_consensus_final.sh -- is anything still going to change?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/check_consensus_final.sh [mainnet|testnet|all]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A consensus rule that changes after block 1 does not update the chain. It
#  invalidates every block mined under the old rule, and the only nodes that
#  cannot see this are the ones already running -- they never re-validate what
#  they have already accepted. The chain looks healthy from the inside and
#  cannot be joined from the outside.
#
#  The testnet was reset twice for exactly that. The second time, the treasury
#  was given its own address while blocks were being mined: 1 to 30 paid the
#  old address, 31 onward paid the new one, and no fresh node could get past
#  height 1. Nothing was wrong with the change. It was made at the wrong time.
#
#  So before a chain is started, this asks the only question that prevents a
#  third reset: is every value the rules depend on final, or is one of them
#  still a placeholder someone means to replace later?
#
#  "Later" is the whole problem. After block 1 there is no later.
