#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  install.sh already refuses to build a checkout that is behind a release
#  which changed a consensus rule. That guard is correct and it fires exactly
#  once -- at install time -- and then never again.
#
#  So the person it cannot reach is precisely the person who needs it: the
#  one who installed in August, built a working node, and has not run
#  anything since. Their node keeps running. The protocol carries blocks, not
#  notices. Nothing anywhere tells them that on 15 September their node will
#  reject every valid block and fork off alone at height 1.
#
#  As of 2026-08-29 one independent operator is in exactly that position, on
#  v0.1.4, and there is no way to reach them. That is not their carelessness.
#  We shipped a warning that only speaks while somebody is listening, and
#  then stopped speaking.
#
#  WHERE THIS WRITES, AND WHY THERE
#
#  Not a log file: nobody reads a log that has nothing wrong in it. Not an
#  email: we do not have their address and would not want it. The one place
#  a node operator reliably looks is the screen they get when they ssh into
#  the machine, so the notice goes in /etc/update-motd.d/ and appears at
#  every login until the version is current, at which point it removes
#  itself.
#
#  It also writes to the journal, so `journalctl -u wam-version-watch` says
#  the same thing to anyone who goes looking.
#
#  A check that cannot be made says nothing at all. GitHub being unreachable
#  is not evidence that a node is out of date, and a warning that cries wolf
#  once is ignored afterwards.
