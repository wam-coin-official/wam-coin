#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 4 September 2026 a mainnet node was started for twenty-one minutes as
#  part of the Phase E rehearsal. Two seconds after port 9555 opened, a node
#  from 69.173.206.211 connected, said /WAM:0.1.6/, and stayed until it was
#  disconnected. That address appears nowhere in the testnet node's journal --
#  not once, ever. Somebody had read the documentation, configured a node for
#  mainnet only, and left it retrying.
#
#  That is the first real operator waiting for launch, and we only saw them
#  because the port happened to be open for a few minutes. Nothing counts
#  them. How many exist is the number that decides whether the BitcoinTalk
#  announcement is early or late, and it is knowable.
#
#  WHY NOT JUST RUN A NODE FOR A DAY
#
#  Because a mainnet node started before 15 September works once and then
#  fails at every restart, with an error about a block from the future, and
#  its datadir has to be emptied afterwards. An unattended upgrade restarted a
#  service on this very machine two days ago. Leaving that trap armed for a
#  day, to collect a number, is a bad trade -- and it is the exact failure
#  scripts/genesis_gate.sh exists to prevent.
#
#  This holds the port and nothing else. No chain, no datadir, no wallet, no
#  gate, nothing to wipe. It cannot mine, cannot serve a block, and cannot be
#  left in a state that breaks the launch.
#
#  HOW IT TELLS A NODE FROM A PORT SCANNER
#
#  The first four bytes. Every WAM message begins with the network magic
#  0x57 0x41 0x4d 0x21 -- "WAM!" -- which Bitcoin's f9 be b4 d9 is not, and
#  which a scanner never sends because it does not know the protocol. A
#  scanner connects and closes; a node introduces itself. That distinction was
#  learned the hard way in this project, from a French address that looked
#  like an operator and was one second of TCP.
#
#  It reads the version message far enough to take the user agent, so the
#  answer is not "somebody connected" but "a node on v0.1.6 is waiting" -- and
#  a node on a version below the consensus floor is a person who needs telling
#  before launch, not after.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
#  It never completes a handshake, so nobody's node believes it found a peer
#  and stops looking for real ones. It replies to nothing and closes at once.
#
#  And it does not publish addresses. Running a node is a favour to this
#  project and a list of who does it is a list of who to attack. The log is
#  local, mode 0600; --report prints counts, versions and countries only.
