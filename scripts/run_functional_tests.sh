#  run_functional_tests.sh -- run WAM's four consensus tests against the
#                             binary that is actually deployed
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/run_functional_tests.sh --host IP [--test NAME]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  test/functional/ holds four tests that ask the questions no unit test can:
#  does a real node, running real validation, actually REJECT a block that
#  breaks the rule?
#
#      feature_wam_devfee.py         WAM-1, the 5% treasury output
#      feature_wam_genesis.py        the premine: five locked tranches
#      feature_wam_pow.py            RandomX is what verifies work, not SHA256d
#      feature_wam_randomx_epoch.py  the key rotates on the epoch boundary
#
#  They had NEVER BEEN EXECUTED. Not once, from the day they were written
#  until 2026-09-14, nine hours before mainnet -- because running them takes
#  Core's own test harness, which this repository does not carry, and nobody
#  had written down where to find one.
#
#  The first execution found a real defect, in the test: feature_wam_genesis
#  still expected the first founder tranche to be liquid at genesis. Its prose
#  and its assertions had both been rewritten when that changed; the list of
#  dates had not, so every lock it checked was a year out.
#
#      AssertionError: not(1820966400 == 0)
#
#  A test nobody runs is a comment that costs CPU. So this is the script that
#  runs them, and it runs them against /usr/local/bin/wamd -- the binary the
#  seeds are running -- not against a fresh build of a hopeful tree.
#
#  HOW
#
#  The harness (test/functional/test_framework/) and test/config.ini come from
#  a configured Core build tree, and one exists on the France host from the
#  original build. The four test files are copied out of that host's CURRENT
#  checkout each run, so what is tested is this repository's tests, never the
#  copies that were in the build tree when it was configured.
#
#  The binaries are chosen by environment variable -- BITCOIND, BITCOINCLI,
#  BITCOINUTIL, BITCOINWALLET -- which is how Core's harness lets a test run
#  against something other than the tree it was built from.

# 24000 is deliberate, not arbitrary. The harness assigns p2p from
# TEST_RUNNER_PORT_MIN and rpc from that plus 5000, twelve nodes wide. Its
# default base of 11000 puts the rpc range at 16000-21000, which contains the
# testnet node's 19554, and the p2p range contains the pool's 13333-13336. A
# test that cannot bind is a test that fails for a reason that has nothing to
# do with consensus. 24000 -> p2p 24000-24011, rpc 29000-29011, tor 34000+.
